# MATE themes

In preparation for moving to Ubuntu MATE 18.04, the best themes for my taste I've found so far available in the repos without a bunch of messing around are:

- **Controls**: BlueMenta or ThinIce
- **Window Border**: Materia-dark-compact
- **Icons**: Papirus-Light
- **Pointer**: MATE (Black)
