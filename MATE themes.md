# MATE themes

In preparation for moving to Ubuntu MATE 18.04, the best themes for my taste I've found so far available in the repos without a bunch of messing around are:

- **Controls**: NumixBlue or BlueMenta
- **Window Border**: Materia-light-compact or Yuyo-Dark
- **Icons**: Papirus-Dark or Papirus-Light
- **Pointer**: DMZ (White) or DMZ (Black)
