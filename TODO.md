# To Do (libinput)
- Allow two-finger scrolling while button is held down
- Eliminate spurious tap when palm rests solidly (or workaround: properly enable disable while typing)
- Resolve issue with clicks not counting from thumb (delay if held)
- Enable click zones and click finger both

# Back Burner / maybe not do
- Make a Debian package https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyRWGzsFdq0 with necessary files

# Done

- Create a more portable keyboard solution
- A type of keyboard to switch to; enable going back and forth
- Port newest libinput to 16.04 and apply no-hysteresis patch
