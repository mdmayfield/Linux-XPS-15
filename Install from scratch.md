## Goal: create a shell script or several to run after first install that will take care of everything.

### First ones to write:
- NVidia Optimus (primus/bumblebee)
- Trackpad settings at boot or at least at login
- Low latency kernel
- Themes as preferred
- Install Bluetooth firmware

### Then:
- TLP settings (and avoid it conflicting with Bumblebee)
- Install some basics like redshift, gimp, kdenlive, etc.
- Install current wine (not 1.6?! as in LTS repos)
- Fix /dev/sda clean message, etc.
