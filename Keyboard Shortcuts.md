# Keyboard Shortcuts
An attempt to adapt my OS to my keyboard shortcut muscle memory, and not the other way around.

1. Swap modifier keys. Currently my approach is to alter `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc` but I'd prefer to do this in ~ somehow.
2. Change keys in Control Center, Unity Tweak Tool, and CompizConfig Settings Manager. (Set switcher to Ctrl-Tab which is physical Alt-Tab)
3. Text editing shortcuts as per something like [this?](http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_17.html)
