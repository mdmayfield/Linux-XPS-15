#Hide Mouse Cursor While Typing

This uses an extension called XBanish with a fix that I found searching through GitHub forks. See "xbanish" repository.

Command line I'm using: `./xbanish -i Shift -i Control -i mod1 -i mod4`

Needed dependencies to build: `x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev libxfixes-dev libxi-dev`
